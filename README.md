# NodePoint #
## Introduction ##

NodePoint (NP) is a simple Web Application Framework (WAF) project based on the Node.js and Bootstrap library. The idea behind NodePoint is to have an entire web site living in one lightweight package, with no external dependencies than these two libraries, yet still offer all the usual features such as content processing, user management, blogs, an API, and more.

In order to run this web app, all you need is Node.js installed. The Bootstrap library is loaded dynamically at runtime. The goal is to have a very simple framework to build and customize, perfect for small projects that do not require a full-featured web server and CMS installed. Feel free to build upon this project to suit your needs.
